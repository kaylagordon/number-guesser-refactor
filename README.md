## About
Number Guesser is a game played by two people who are attempting to guess the random number generated by the computer.

## How to play
 * Players will first enter a min and max range.
 * Once the player clicks Update the computer will generate a random number. (Note: If no range is given the computer will generate one on its own, between 1 and 100.
 * Players will enter their names and guesses in the textboxes and click Submit.
 * Immediately, the computer wil give feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
 * If a player guesses the right answer, a card will appear and then they can play another game.
 * To continue playing but reset the textboxs, players can click Reset.
 * To start all over, players can click Clear.
